# .dotfiles
This is the repository for my dotfiles as it continuously grows, expands, transforms, and evolves. 
## Repository details
The .dotfiles work on a single script file that installs all my apps, terminal plugins and frameworks with a single double-click. To avoid overcomplication of tedious folder architecture and because the extent of my system configuration is not as complex, all primary files live in this single repository and contain enough of the instructions needed instead of abstracting every different type of system setup.

This folder structure was heavily inspired from Belgian software engineer [Dries Vints](https://driesvints.com/) and his [dotfiles](https://github.com/driesvints/dotfiles).
